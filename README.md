# ORFixFaceApplierCpp
Current ORFix applier doesn't handle face section and not getting update for a while  
I decide to make my own

## Build
- Visual Studio 2019
- Download `wxWidgets-3.1.5`  
Unpack to `C:\wxWidgets-3.1.5`  
Generate with cmake-gui  
Build `C:\wxWidgets-3.1.5\build\msw\wx_vc16.sln`  
It's a bit tricky to make a tutorial here  
that build a fully static linked single binary   
within a few lines of sentences, good luck
- Environment variable `WXWIN` as C:\wxWidgets-3.1.5
- Open project sln with Visual Studio
- Build solution in Release x86

## Usage
Same as ORFix applier
